# CircuitPython Web IDE

You can access the [CircuitPython Web IDE](https://mr-coxall.github.io/CircuitPython-IDE/) at : https://mr-coxall.github.io/CircuitPython-IDE/

The goal of this project is to develop and IDE specifically for CircuitPython that will work on all systems. Mu is wonderful but in particular it does not work on Chromebooks. You can use the Chromebook's built in text editor, it even has syntax highlighting, but there is no REPL so debugging is really hard.

The intent is to have a supper simple and lightweight IDE that can be used on any device that has a Chrome browser. Maybe even small enough so it could be keps right on the CircuitPython device!
